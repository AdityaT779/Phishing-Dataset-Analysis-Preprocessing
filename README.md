# Phishing-Dataset-Analysis-Preprocessing

Overview :

This project deals with analyzing and cleaning a phishing dataset using Python and python's libraries. I learned basic but important aspects of ML model building, like how to load data, create new features, handle missing values, encode labels, and make simple visualizations.


Steps in building cleaned dataset :

1. Loaded the dataset and checked its contents.

2. Filled in missing values.

3. Turned categorical labels (Phishing/Legitimate) into numbers using LabelEncoder

4. Added new features like URL length and Status.

5. Made a bar chart to show how many URLs are phishing, legitimate, or unknoen

6. Made a histogram to show the distribution of URL lengths.

7. Saved the cleaned dataset to a new CSV file.
